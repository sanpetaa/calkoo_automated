# Calkoo Test Automation Base

#### About 
The goal of this project is to fulfill the homework I get from the Global Blue REX Team.
##### Task

* Please identify at least two test cases for the automation:
* * explain why you would choose specifically those
* * automate them using Cypress, Robot, or Selenium (if having experience)

#### Actual Testcases

##### testcase.CheckCalculations.java 

Checking the whole calculation process and comparing it to my local calculation, because this is the main function of the site.

 I selected the 3 most commonly used countries from global blue TOP destinations: https://www.globalblue.com/corporate/media/press/global-blue-research-confirms-the-chinese-are-still-the-most-valuable-globe-shoppers, because I do not have business information about the most important countries. 

Check on all available VAT rates
even If  I am filling the Net price, VatSum, or Price fields
And Checking the pie chart if it is correct or not. 

I used soft assertions.
In case of any failure and the application taking screenshots.

##### testcase.VatRateAvailable.java 
If any change on the webpage will happen
And if  multipliers will not be equivalent to the VAT rates
Then the calculation would be wrong. 
These pieces of information are necessary for my first test case.
